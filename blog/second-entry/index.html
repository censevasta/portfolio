    <li>Blogs are everywhere!<br></li> <li>This can be both wonderful and overwhelming.<br> If you have an interest in a topic, all you have to
    do is search for that topic plus the word “blog,” and you’re likely to find some excellent blogs out there.<br> Below,
    you’ll find sample blogs that cover topics like food, education, nursing, and video games.<br> These are just four samples
    but will give you an opportunity to see how blogs can vary in theme, style, scope, and how entries can vary in length. <br></li>
    
    <li>There is no limit to the topics you’ll find covered in blogs. If you’re working to create your own blog, do a little
    research on other blogs on that topic.<br> Think about a way your blog can be different!</p></ul></li>
